The algorithm that I've written find the number of factors of a number by brute
force. It takes each number n and calculates n%i for each number 2 <= i <= sqrt(n).
Every time this calculation returns zero, it increments the counter by 2.

Because this algorithm takes order O(1) time to calculate the modulus,
and runs this calculation sqrt(n) - 1 times, we can compute that the entire
algorithm takes O(1*sqrt(n)) = O(sqrt(n)) time.

The code can be found in Driver.java, with the average times for one run plotted
in the images Graph1.png and Graph2.png. The output from one run of the code
(the run used to generate the graphs) can be found in the file TerminalOutput.txt
